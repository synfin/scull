This is an implementation of scull from Linux Device Drivers 3rd Edition.

I have copied a lot of the existing code from Oreilly's provided pages.  However, the kernel I am using is 2.6.28-13 and not the older kernel Oreilly publishers used.  The code currently does not work as I am still in the process of porting it.
